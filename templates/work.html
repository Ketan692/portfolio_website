    <li>Morse Code Generator</li>

    <p>Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. Morse code is named after Samuel Morse, one of the inventors of the telegraph.Early in the nineteenth century, European experimenters made progress with electrical signaling systems, using a variety of techniques including static electricity and electricity from Voltaic piles producing electrochemical and electromagnetic changes. These experimental designs were precursors to practical telegraphic applications.William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone in Britain developed an electrical telegraph that used electromagnets in its receivers. They obtained an English patent in June 1837 and demonstrated it on the London and Birmingham Railway, making it the first commercial telegraph. Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Eduard Weber (1833) as well as Carl August von Steinheil (1837) used codes with varying word lengths for their telegraph systems.[16] In 1841, Cooke and Wheatstone built a telegraph that printed the letters from a wheel of typefaces struck by a hammer.</p>
    <li>Password Generator</li>
    <img class="password" src="static/password_generator.png" alt="">
    <p>A password generator is a software tool that creates random or customized passwords for users. It helps users create stronger passwords that provide greater security for a given type of access.Some password generators are simply random password generators. These programs produce complex/strong passwords with combinations of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters such as braces, asterisks, slashes, etc.

Other types of password generators are made to generate more recognizable passwords rather than a completely random set of characters. There are tools for generating pronounceable passwords, as well as custom tools that allow users to set detailed criteria. For instance, a user could set a request for a certain number of characters, a certain mix of letters and numbers, a certain number of special characters, or any other criteria for generating a new password.

Password generators help those who have to constantly come up with new passwords to ensure authorized access for programs and to manage a large number of passwords for identity and access management. Other kinds of tools include a password vault, where users manage large numbers of passwords in a secure location.</p>
    <li>Url Shortener</li>
    <img class="shortener"src="static/url_shortner.png" alt="">
    <p class="url_last">URL shortening is a technique on the World Wide Web in which a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) may be made substantially shorter and still direct to the required page. This is achieved by using a redirect which links to the web page that has a long URL. For example, the URL "https://example.com/assets/category_B/subcategory_C/Foo/" can be shortened to "https://example.com/Foo", and the URL "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_shortening" can be shortened to "https://w.wiki/U". Often the redirect domain name is shorter than the original one. A friendly URL may be desired for messaging technologies that limit the number of characters in a message (for example SMS), for reducing the amount of typing required if the reader is copying a URL from a print source, for making it easier for a person to remember, or for the intention of a permalink. In November 2009, the shortened links of the URL shortening service Bitly were accessed 2.1 billion times.</p>
